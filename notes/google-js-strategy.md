# Google's "Future of Javascript"

Javascript is inherently flawed. Google's strategy is 2 fold:

* Work with TC39 to evolve JS. Low risk / low reward.
* New language (Dart). High risk / high reward.


* Javascript has fundamental problems.
  * Example: Existence of a single `Number` primitive.
  * Cannot be tooled.
  * Has inherent performance problems.


## Evolve JS

* Paramount that Google maintain a leadership position on open web standards.
* Important to push the standards bodies faster.
* Provide tooling (ES5 -> ES3) to target all browsers, speeding up adoption.

## Dart (Dash)

* Performance
* Developer Usability. Keep dynamic, no compile, easy to start nature of JS.
* Tooling. Optional types enable tooling. Types not *required* but encouraged for large-scale projects.
