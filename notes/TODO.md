# Javascript TODO

### npm

* Local file system environment.
* `package.json`: scripts and semver.
* Transpilers: Babel (Facebook) vs. Traceur (Google)
  * What is the current state of transpilers?

### React

* Is `react-test` compiling down to ES5? Thru `babel`? How to run ES6 without compiling down to ES5?
