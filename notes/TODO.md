# Javascript TODO

## Tests

* `functions.test.js` - add tests for closures.

## Language

* State of ES6: are all relevant browsers (n-1 for evergreen, IE11) fully support ES6?
* Constructor functions.
* Adding methods to objects - understanding `prototype` and `this`.
* `Object.prototype` available functions. Metaprogramming.
* Do classes in JS provide any encapsulation?
* Modules : what is the difference between `require` and `import`?
* Exception handling.

## Libraries

* ES6 built-ins. Including "native" types (`String`, `Boolean`, etc).
* lodash
* Library to check for array equality.
* What are the built in functions / native environment?

## Tools

### v8

* v8 - JIT compilation, execution, relationship to Node.

### Node

* What is the node environment? What is the top level (host) object? How does it compare to a browser?
* What functions does the host environment have on it?

### Webpack

###  Typescript

* What does the VS Code team think of Typescript?

### npm

* Local file system environment.
* `package.json`: scripts and semver.
* Transpilers: Babel (Facebook) vs. Traceur (Google)


### React

* Is `react-test` compiling down to ES5? Thru `babel`? How to run ES6 without compiling down to ES5?
