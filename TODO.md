# Javascript TODO

## Tests

* `functions.test.js` - add tests for closures.

## Language

* State of ES6: are all relevant browsers (n-1 for evergreen, IE11) fully support ES6?
* What does the VS Code team think of Typescript?
* Constructor functions.
* Adding methods to objects - understanding `prototype` and `this`.

## Libraries

* ES6 built-ins. Including "native" types (`String`, `Boolean`, etc).
* lodash
* Functions to check for array equality.

## Tools

* v8 - JIT compilation, execution, relationship to Node.

* Code completion for `Jest`.

* Typescript
* `npm`
  * Local file system environment.
  * `package.json`: scripts and semver.
* Transpilers: Babel (Facebook) vs. Traceur (Google)
